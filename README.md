# YOLO-tennis-analysis
We are going to use YOLO to analyze tennis points

## Description:
This repository contains a project that utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to analyze tennis points. The project focuses on analyzing the speed of the ball and the distance covered by the players during a tennis match.

## Features:
- Utilizes YOLO for real-time object detection of tennis balls and players.
- Calculates the speed of the tennis ball based on its trajectory.
- Estimates the distance covered by players using tracking algorithms.
- Provides visualizations and statistics for analysis.

## Dependencies:

- Python3
- YOLOv5 and/or YOLOv8 (or newer versions)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Acknowledgements:

The YOLO algorithm implementation used in this project is based on YOLOv5 and YOLOv8.
Special thanks to the open-source community for their contributions to the libraries and tools used in this project.
